# API Endpoint Reference

A one-page index of every endpoint currently exposed by the backend, grouped by phase and cross-linked to the architecture docs that explain each one.

The **authoritative request/response shape** is [docs/openapi.yaml](../openapi.yaml). This page is a navigation aid — endpoint names, scopes, the service each calls, the architecture chapter to read for context.

---

## Scopes

| Prefix | Scope | Auth |
|---|---|---|
| `/v1/auth/...` | Player | none required for `magic_link`/`exchange`, Bearer for the rest |
| `/v1/admin/auth/...` | Admin | same, scoped to admin |
| `/v1/servers`, `/v1/worlds`, `/v1/kingdoms`, `/v1/armies`, `/v1/battles` | Player | player-scope Bearer |
| `/v1/admin/servers`, `/v1/admin/worlds` | Admin | admin-scope Bearer |

A token from the wrong scope returns 401 — see [02-identity-and-servers.md](02-identity-and-servers.md#two-actors-one-substrate).

Errors follow `{error: {code, message, retry_after?}}` — see [01-foundations.md](01-foundations.md#error-envelope).

Every response carries `X-Request-Id`.

| `capture` (owned) | `Marches::Arrive` → `Nodes::Attack` → `Combat::Resolve` (or walk-in) | PvP at the node region, undefended ⇒ instant take |
| `claim_ruin` | `Marches::Arrive` → `Ruins::Claim` → `Combat::ResolveGarrison` | warehouse-capped cache grant; `dun.ruin.claimed` event |

| `wonder_phase` `enter_consecration` event (+90h) | `ScheduledEvents::Dispatch` → `Wonders::EnterConsecration` | deducts 5%, schedules `complete` at +24h |
| `wonder_phase` `complete` event (+24h consecration) | `ScheduledEvents::Dispatch` → `Wonders::Complete` | archives world, sets winner |

---

## Phase 10 — Round end, archive, leaderboards, account deletion

See [11-round-end-and-archive.md](11-round-end-and-archive.md). The three new endpoints are already listed in their natural sections above (auth, server surface, player world surface). Trigger paths driven by `Wonders::Complete` / `Wonders::Destroy` / `Combat::ApplyOutcome` (no new endpoints):

| Trigger | Service chain | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wonder completes (Consecration survives) | `Wonders::Complete` → `Rounds::End` → archive snapshot + stats + title + leaderboards | round freeze |
| Wonder destroyed by damage | `Wonders::Destroy` → `Wreckers::Attribute` | credits killing-blow player with `wonders_destroyed` |
| Player-vs-player battle resolved | `Combat::ApplyOutcome` → `Profiles::Increment` | raid stats (launched/defended/won, resources_looted) |

## What's not here

| Phase | Endpoints (planned) | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 11 | `/v1/servers/:id/reports`, `/v1/admin/servers/:id/reports`, `/v1/admin/servers/:id/audit`, `/v1/admin/servers/:id/rate_limits` | not shipped |
| Phase 12 | `/v1/worlds/:id/weather` | not shipped |
| Phase 13 | `/v1/kingdoms/:id/scout`, `/v1/kingdoms/:id/scout-reports` | not shipped |

Track these in [TODO.md](../../TODO.md). When a phase ships, update this page and add a new chapter (`07-...`).
